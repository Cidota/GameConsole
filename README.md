# GameConsole
A basic game console implemented using an STM32L476RG

# Goal
The goal of this project is to create a game console with several games starting from a micro-controller, a TFT-LCD and several buttons. We will code in C, try to use the minimum amount of external libraries and keep the project structured in such a way so that we are able to easily swap out any components, add any functionalities and add games.

The first version will be a snake game clone.

Future versions will add new games and additional functionality such as wireless communication and game selection.

# Demo
The current version uses the STM32L476RG, a 3.5 inch TFT-LCD and 4 buttons to allow the user to play a snake game clone.
